# ADC (Analog to Digital Converter)
The ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) in the ATMEGA328 is used to convert analog signals (voltages) into digital data that can be processed by the microcontroller. The ADC is typically used in applications where the input signal is an analog value, such as reading sensors, measuring voltages, etc. The ATMEGA328 features a 10-bit ADC, which provides a resolution of 1024 distinct values for any input voltage between 0 and the reference voltage.

The ADC on the ATMEGA328 is capable of reading multiple channels (pins) and can be configured for various reference voltages. It is essential to understand the registers controlling the ADC and how to utilize them to get accurate readings.
